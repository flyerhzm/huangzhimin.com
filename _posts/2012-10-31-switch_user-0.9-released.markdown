[switch_user][0] provides a convenient way to switch current user that
speeds up your development and reproduce user specified error on
production.

Today switch_user gem 0.9.0 is released, all thanks to [Luke Cowell][1].

He is a collaborator of switch_user gem, and did a great job for 0.9.0
gem.

1. did lots of refactors.
2. added unit tests.
3. made switch_user a rails engine.

check out the changelog [here][2].

I also updated [switch_user example][3] to use switch_user 0.9.0.
